    <h1> JavaScript HTML DOM Animation</h1>
    <p> To demonstrate how to use basic HTML animations with JavaScript, we will use a basic web page.</p>
    <p> My first JavaScript Animation:</p>

    <div id="animation-container">
        <p id="animation-object"></p>
    </div>

    <p> In addition to creating the paragraph where the animation will go, we need to create an animation container, as well, around the animated paragraph. </p>
    <p> We need to style the container as relative and the animation as absolute since it is inside the relative container. We will do that in styles.css </p>

    <h2> The Animation Code</h2>
